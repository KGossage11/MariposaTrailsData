If you keep a sharp eye, you might spot some of the many reptiles and amphibians that call this place home.\nOn cool or rainy days\u2014or late at night\u2014you might catch sight of a Sierra Newt. These smooth-skinned amphibians hide during sunny hours to keep from drying out. Their deep brown backs and bright orange bellies make them easy to recognize. Found only in California, Sierra Newts are a special part of our state\u2019s natural heritage. Just don\u2019t touch\u2014this newt\u2019s skin secretes a strong toxin that can be absorbed through wounds or ingestion.\nAnother resident to respect is the North Pacific Rattlesnake. Though they sometimes rattle a warning, not all do\u2014so watch your step and give them plenty of space. Rattlesnakes are often mistaken for harmless Gopher Snakes, but their heads are more triangular and distinct from their bodies.\nEvery creature here plays a role in keeping the Sierra ecosystem healthy\u2014so observe carefully, and tread lightly.\n",

        "postText": "The Merced River is a living sculpture, carved by glaciers, gravity, and time. Flowing through Yosemite\u2019s steep canyons, the river winds past cliffs and boulder fields, shaping the landscape as it goes.\nIts journey begins high in the Sierra Nevada, racing through glacial gorges before easing through Yosemite Valley. From there, it tumbles toward Lake McClure, offering stunning rapids, serene pools, and first-class opportunities for hiking, rafting, and photography.\nThe Bureau of Land Management helps protect over 1,600 acres of limestone salamander habitat along the Merced\u2019s tributaries. These efforts keep the river\u2019s ecosystems healthy and diverse.\nAs you walk the trail, remember: the Merced isn\u2019t just water\u2014it\u2019s a force that has shaped mountains and life for millions of years. Treat it with care, and it will keep flowing wild and free for generations to come.\n",

        "postText": "Look closely at the rocks\u2014each layer is a clue to Earth\u2019s restless past. The rocks along Hite\u2019s Cove Trail began as flat layers of sediment. Over eons, tectonic forces folded and tilted them skyward, creating the dramatic near-vertical formations seen today.\nThese are mostly meta-sedimentary rocks, transformed by heat and pressure into slate and schist. Their swirled, wavy patterns\u2014called \u201ctombstone rocks\u201d when they stand upright\u2014tell of powerful mountain-building forces.\nErosion by glaciers and rivers later carved valleys and canyons, while wildfires and time shaped the soils above. Even underground, geology continues to influence life: different rock types produce unique soils that support different plant communities.\nFrom golden quartz veins to the slate underfoot, the ground beneath you is a geologic story millions of years in the making.\n",

Their deep connection to the land began centuries ago, guided by spiritual beliefs that the Great Spirit led them here.\nUnder Chief Teneiya, the tribe thrived until the 1850s, when the California Gold Rush brought conflict. The Mariposa Battalion forced many Ahwahneechee onto reservations, though some resisted and continued their traditions in secret.\nThe Ahwahneechee excelled at basket weaving, gathering willow, redbud, and tule-root for intricate designs passed down through generations. They also honored the earth through sacred dance ceremonies, where rhythmic footwork and song gave thanks for life.\nThough much was lost through displacement and hardship, Ahwahneechee descendants still carry their heritage today, reminding us that this trail runs through living ancestral ground.\n",

In 1862, John Hite and Calvin Wilson filed a mining claim after discovering a rich quartz vein. The area flourished, reaching its peak between 1875 and 1880.\nMiners, families, and merchants followed, carving wagon roads and trails through the rugged canyon. The Hite Gold Quartz Company later purchased the mine, and by the 1880s, a full community had formed with hotels, lodges, and mills.\nIn the 1980s, the Sierra National Forest took stewardship of the land, preserving its unique mix of history and wilderness. As you walk, you\u2019re following the same paths once trod by prospectors and pioneers\u2014only now, gold seekers have been replaced by flower seekers!",

        "postText": "The Ahwahneechee people knew this land as both pantry and pharmacy. About sixty percent of their diet came from black oak acorns, ground into flour for hearty acorn mush. They also gathered seeds, roots, berries, and bulbs like mariposa tulip, bunchgrass, and gooseberries.\nPlants were medicine too. Yarrow eased wounds and stomach ailments; sagebrush, mint, and California laurel bay helped with healing. Berries from the whiteleaf manzanita became cider, while juniper tea soothed colds.\nNature provided materials for life: milkweed fibers became thread and fishing lines, cedar wood formed bows, and willow and redbud were woven into stunning baskets. Every plant had a purpose, every harvest a ceremony of respect.\nToday, those traditions remind us to see the forest not as a resource to take\u2014but as a partner in survival.\n",

The thick bark of sequoias protects them from heat, while species like mariposa lilies and lupines sprout best after a burn.\nWhen the 2018 Ferguson Fire swept through this region, it cleared old growth and made way for new life. Seeds buried deep in the soil germinated, and resprouting shrubs returned greener than before.\nBut as the climate warms, wildfires grow hotter and faster, fueled by drought-killed trees and dry brush. Healthy fire cycles are natural\u2014catastrophic ones are not. Supporting forest management and fire-wise hiking helps protect this delicate balance.\nOut here, every charred trunk and sprouting wildflower tells the same story: from ashes, life begins again.\n",

Census data often undercounted them, but historians estimate 75 to 150 Chinese miners once lived here.\nChinatown stood near the mill site, separated from the main settlement by steep hills.

You can still spot bits of the old rock abutments along the trail\u2014ghostly reminders of a time when ore carts and miners crossed daily.\nThough today\u2019s modern bridge sits several miles away, these historic crossings remind us that Hite\u2019s Cove was once a place of enterprise and daring engineering.\n",

Two tramways carried ore down the mountainside to the mills below, powered by water from a 500-foot flume. It\u2019s estimated that between 1863 and 1882, over $3 million in gold was extracted\u2014worth roughly $100 million today!\nHite\u2019s mine stood out because he kept ownership rather than selling to big investors, an unusual move for the time.
